### Questions

#### How to change image files ?

Just replace files in `files/img/background` and `files/img/characters`
#### How to add/remove images and edit the animation duration time ? 
Example : 
You want to have just 3 backgrounds and 4 different characters.
Just edit `files/js/loader.js` with these values :
```JAVASCRIPT
maxCharacters  = 4;
maxBackgrounds = 3;
animationTime  = 7000;
```
Be sure to only have 4 backgrounds and 3 characters images file in the /img folders and keep the files naming.
